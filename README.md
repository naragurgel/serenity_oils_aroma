- The page is prioritizing features based on how practical and workable they are (feasibility) and how significant they are to the website's success (importance).
- Features with high feasibility and high importance are at the core of the website's functionality and will be included in our initial development.
- Features with high feasibility but slightly lower importance might be part of the development too, but they won't be our main focus initially.
- The goal is to deliver a website that effectively meets the needs of users and supports the business goals, so the focus will be on the "In" features.
- For instance, enabling users to add posts to their favorites and sharing their testimonials and ratings are essential as they enhance user engagement and trust.
- I havent't create a mobile app, add to generate revenue for businesses and SALES section because the goal is to prioritize the essencial feature, but they will be on the list for the future.

## Scope

- <strong>Basic Product Catalog:</strong> Initially, offer a smaller range of essential oils and products to keep the catalog simple and manageable.
- <strong>Essential Information:</strong> Provide essential information about aromatherapy and a few select products, focusing on quality rather than quantity.-
- <strong>Simplified Checkout:</strong> Start with a basic checkout process that includes only essential fields, excluding optional features.
- <strong>Limited Blog Content:</strong> Begin with a smaller number of blog posts that cover the most essential topics related to aromatherapy.
- <strong>Single Payment Option:</strong> Start with one payment method, such as credit/debit cards, and delay integrating other payment options.
- <strong>Basic Design:</strong> Begin with a simple and clean website design, focusing on functionality rather than elaborate visual elements.
- <strong>Limited Contact Options:</strong> Provide a simple contact form for user inquiries, without extensive customer support channels.

The reduced scope approach allows for a quicker and more focused website launch, providing room for gradual expansion and enhancement based on user feedback and business growth.

## Design Choices

### Colors

![colors](https://github.com/naragurgel/serenity_oils_aroma/assets/112726044/363f46ba-aab6-402e-ad11-d52f13f045b8)

-  The color palette reflects the natural, calming, and organic essence of aromatherapy. The warm browns, beige, and soft grays create a harmonious and inviting atmosphere, while the white background ensures readability and a clean user experience. It's important to use these colors consistently throughout the webpage to maintain a cohesive and visually appealing design.

### Typography

- I selected the 'Lato' font-family for the Serenity Oils website due to its excellent legibility and modern appearance. With a clean and professional aesthetic, 'Lato' ensures a pleasant reading experience for users while maintaining compatibility across various devices and browsers. Its versatile nature also allows for consistent use in both headings and body text, contributing to the site's overall cohesive and contemporary design, which complements the soothing and natural theme of aromatherapy products.

### Images
- The choice of the hero image with an oil bottle in conjunction with the specified color palette is deliberate and aligned with the desired visual and emotional impact of the Serenity Oils website. The color palette, consisting of warm browns, beige, soft grays, and a white background, was meticulously selected to evoke a sense of naturalness, tranquility, and authenticity that resonate with the essence of aromatherapy.

### Frameworks

For the Serenity Oils website, I've chosen to use the Bootstrap framework. I picked this because it help me make the website look good and work well. Bootstrap gives tools to organize the layout so it fits on different screens, like computers and phones. Bootstrap also provides ready-made pieces that we can use, like buttons and forms, which saves us time when building. We like that we can change how these pieces look to match our website's calming and natural style. We went with Bootstrap because it's like a toolbox that helps us create a website that's easy to use and looks nice. Plus, lots of people use it, so if we have any problems, we can find help easily. It's like having a helper while building our website.

# Testing
## Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
🚨**Required**

To save time, you can create this type of table
in [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

As of Feb 14, 2022 CI students can take advantage of the Student Developer Pack where you have access to great things
like [browserstack](https://education.github.com/pack/offers/#browserstack) You should have received an email about how
to activate your student Developer Pack, here's
a [slack](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C0L316Z96/p1644946870567999) with details if you can't find it
in the associated thread.

Start with a brief explanation of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site
across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints. You can add a column about the spot checking path
you took or write it out here:

1. Visit https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share to figure out the most popular browsers & operating system combos seen across the we for the geographic region, and platoform(s) and screen sizes you expect your users to belong to. 

1. Include a sentence about why you chose the combinations you did.

1. Create a table that lists out what devices, browsers, and operating system you tested your application on and a brief description of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints.

1. if you can't find the brower/device/OS combinations you want on Browserstack with your github student webpack (or you didn't activate that in time), note what you'd ideally test on then what you ended up testing on as a compromise. 

> **Example:**
> To ensure the code was functional and looked good on varoius devices I tested a couple of generic flows though my site on using the following Tool/Device combinations. The device/browser/and OS combinations were used based on reports found at [browser market share](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) taken on MM/DD/YYYY:

Note, you might find it easier to create a test case for each tool/device and link to the test case in the table here.

## Accessibility Testing
🚨**Required**

You should have test cases for accessibility and links to them here. Start with a brief paragraph and then link to the
test cases. If you are ambitious you can record the screen of you using the keyboard, convert it to a gif and upload it
to the test case too.

**example**
> To ensure that the site was accessible to people with visual impairments, I used chrome's dev tools, lighthouse audits to ensure I had a score in the green for accessibility and that I could keyboard navigate through the page.
>
> Here are links to the test cases for each which contains the screenshot for the lighthouse audit.
> - [home page accessibility test](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ci_mentor_insights/issues/12)
> - [experience page accessibility test](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ci_mentor_insights/issues/13)
> - [skills page accessibility test](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ci_mentor_insights/issues/14)
> - [recommendations page accessibility test](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ci_mentor_insights/issues/15)
>
> To ensure the site was accessibility to people with physical impairments, I tried to navigate the site using tabbed navigation:
> - [site tabbed navigation test](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ci_mentor_insights/issues/10)

You can totally combine the tabbed navigation in the accessibility test and have 2 expected criteria, it's all up to
you!

## Validation Testing
🚨**Required**

You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation. In this section you should write up any
websites you used to validate your code so there is credit given to those sites. Then add links to the test cases you
put into GitHub for the validation. You can copy your validation success to those tests.

The following site were used to aid in validation testing:

- **[CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)**

> If you only have one CSS file, you can just run the validator through one deployed page URL, if you have custom CSS for diffent pages, make sure you hit those different URLS

- **[HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)**

> For each view you wrote, you should validate the HTML and have a test case for it linked to from here
> NOTE: You may need to right-click to view the source of each page and paste that into the validator if you need to go through authentication to get to the page.

- **[JS validation](https://jshint.com)**

> for each .js file, copy the code and paste it into this site, and have a test case for it linked to from here. You can have warnings, but no errors.
> if using ES6, add this before pasting in your file: `/*jshint esversion: 6 */ `, similarily you can update it to 7 if you see warnings about ES7 syntax `/*jshint esversion: 7 */ `

- **[CI's pep8 tool](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)** 

> for each .py file you created, copy the source code and paste it into this site, and have a test case for it linked to from here.
> include a screenshot of results in the test case showing NO ERRORS. (you should do this for all .py files in your repo)
> 
> **run.py**
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/212106175-36b2f18a-7c75-458d-94dd-9886e81c71f3.png)

> Ideally you would have no errors remaining outside of line too long which you can fix by 
> 
> adding
> ```$python 
> # noqa
> ```
> There is a space before the # and after it to skip the quality assurance for that line.
> 
> Note any errors or warnings you are ignoring and why.

- **[JSON validation](https://jsonlint.com/)**

> for each .json file, you should copy the code and paste it into this site, and have a test case for it linked to from here.

## Automated Testing
🚀 **merit & beyhond**

**NOTE: If you want MERIT or Higher, you MUST have some automated testing**
If you managed to write jasmine tests or some django tests, note those files out here and how to run them.

https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ms4_challenger/blob/master/documentation/TESTING.md is my write up about my automated testing and how I ran them, but a simple test I'd recommend is a views test that tests authentication and any views you limit to superusers or logged in users.

https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ms4_challenger/blob/master/challenges/tests/test_views.py

## Defects
🚨**Required**

At this point you really should be using GITHUB's Issues to track these as it helps you with the AGILE process
requirement as it's really easy to copy/paste screenshots in and then write up how you closed them.

[Here's a brief overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDS5tZeMO77Dfq85IZGMSV6C41XaPm9FwcpR3k-UTVc/edit#heading=h.542xzc8ufx4x)
I put together on how to do this.

is what my custom tempalte looks like in the UX

## Defects of Note
🚀 **merit & beyhond**

Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and how you finally
ended up resolving them. Just create a link to the issues/defect of note.

### Outstanding Defects

It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found. If you know of something that isn't quite right, list it out and
explain why you chose not to resolve it. Again, do this in gitHub and provide a link to the defects you are not closing
and ensure they have a comment in them.

## Fork and Clone the Repository
🚀 **merit & beyond**
To keep the main reposotory for this project clean, please fork the repostiory into your own account. GitHub has [forking directions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) but here's what you might do:
1. login to your own gitHub account
2. navigate to [my repository](URL OF YOUR LIVE REPOSITORY)
3. In the top right corner of the page, click fork 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/213840378-e785eaa0-712b-468c-bcda-64fde56eae44.png)

4. set yourself as the owner
5. change the name of the repo if you want
6. add a description if you want
7. choose what to copy, typicall the main branch only
8. click the snazy green button

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/213840549-5bef12ae-198e-412b-84b6-0cc718b6fa1d.png)

9. To get files to your local environment, you need to clone it: click the code button
10. Copy the url as needed (here's gitHub instructions)[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository}



## Development Deployment 
🚨**Required** 

This section should describe the process someone would have to go through to get the local working in GitPod, or your preferred IDE. Start from installing the chrome extension then clicking the green gitpod button in THEIR FORKED repository, the enumerate the steps to walk them through the process as if they were brand new to this proccess. **Include screenshots** where applicable.

**Key points to cover** 
- Install required python packages: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Create env.py
- What to put in the env.py, don’t disclose real values
>  - EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - EMAIL_USERNAME=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - CLOUDINARY_URL=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - DEV=True
- Apply Database Migrations so the database starts up `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a super user so you can add and inspect things via django admin  `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Preload data: Sometimes you might want to include steps to create data in the admin or preload a data dump [coderwall blog](https://coderwall.com/p/mvsoyg/django-dumpdata-and-loaddata) has examples on how to dump data and load it which saves a bunch of time when deploying the application from a local database to a hosted database but you don’t  have to do this step
- Start the server `python3 manage.py runserver`


## Production Deployment
🚨**Required** 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a server where anyone can access the url without your machine running. This is typically Heroku. **Include screenshots** if you think they would make the process easier. Start with getting an heroku account and then setting up databases and other packages.

If you have project settings required for Heroku, provide a table of the keys and values. Do not share your personal
keys but either cut them out of the screenshot or say <YOUR_VALUE> and include links on how the user would obtain such
values.

**Key points to cover** 
- cerating new app
- setting app name
- setting region
- entering dreaded billing info
- subscribing to a plan
- setting up db
- adding environmental values- have a list or table so user has less chance of typos
>  - EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
>  - DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
>  - EMAIL_USERNAME
>  - SECRET_KEY
>  - CLOUDINARY_URL
>  - COLLECT_STATIC
- adding build packages
- deploy
- gitHub connection
- auto vs manul deploy
- monotior logs
