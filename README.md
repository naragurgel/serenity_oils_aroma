- The page is prioritizing features based on how practical and workable they are (feasibility) and how significant they are to the website's success (importance).
- Features with high feasibility and high importance are at the core of the website's functionality and will be included in our initial development.
- Features with high feasibility but slightly lower importance might be part of the development too, but they won't be our main focus initially.
- The goal is to deliver a website that effectively meets the needs of users and supports the business goals, so the focus will be on the "In" features.
- For instance, enabling users to add posts to their favorites and sharing their testimonials and ratings are essential as they enhance user engagement and trust.
- I havent't create a mobile app, add to generate revenue for businesses and SALES section because the goal is to prioritize the essencial feature, but they will be on the list for the future.

## Scope

- <strong>Basic Product Catalog:</strong> Initially, offer a smaller range of essential oils and products to keep the catalog simple and manageable.
- <strong>Essential Information:</strong> Provide essential information about aromatherapy and a few select products, focusing on quality rather than quantity.-
- <strong>Simplified Checkout:</strong> Start with a basic checkout process that includes only essential fields, excluding optional features.
- <strong>Limited Blog Content:</strong> Begin with a smaller number of blog posts that cover the most essential topics related to aromatherapy.
- <strong>Single Payment Option:</strong> Start with one payment method, such as credit/debit cards, and delay integrating other payment options.
- <strong>Basic Design:</strong> Begin with a simple and clean website design, focusing on functionality rather than elaborate visual elements.
- <strong>Limited Contact Options:</strong> Provide a simple contact form for user inquiries, without extensive customer support channels.

The reduced scope approach allows for a quicker and more focused website launch, providing room for gradual expansion and enhancement based on user feedback and business growth.

## Design Choices

### Colors

![colors](https://github.com/naragurgel/serenity_oils_aroma/assets/112726044/363f46ba-aab6-402e-ad11-d52f13f045b8)

-  The color palette reflects the natural, calming, and organic essence of aromatherapy. The warm browns, beige, and soft grays create a harmonious and inviting atmosphere, while the white background ensures readability and a clean user experience. It's important to use these colors consistently throughout the webpage to maintain a cohesive and visually appealing design.

### Typography

- I selected the 'Lato' font-family for the Serenity Oils website due to its excellent legibility and modern appearance. With a clean and professional aesthetic, 'Lato' ensures a pleasant reading experience for users while maintaining compatibility across various devices and browsers. Its versatile nature also allows for consistent use in both headings and body text, contributing to the site's overall cohesive and contemporary design, which complements the soothing and natural theme of aromatherapy products.

### Images
- The choice of the hero image with an oil bottle in conjunction with the specified color palette is deliberate and aligned with the desired visual and emotional impact of the Serenity Oils website. The color palette, consisting of warm browns, beige, soft grays, and a white background, was meticulously selected to evoke a sense of naturalness, tranquility, and authenticity that resonate with the essence of aromatherapy.

### Frameworks

For the Serenity Oils website, I've chosen to use the Bootstrap framework. I picked this because it help me make the website look good and work well. Bootstrap gives tools to organize the layout so it fits on different screens, like computers and phones. Bootstrap also provides ready-made pieces that we can use, like buttons and forms, which saves us time when building. We like that we can change how these pieces look to match our website's calming and natural style. We went with Bootstrap because it's like a toolbox that helps us create a website that's easy to use and looks nice. Plus, lots of people use it, so if we have any problems, we can find help easily. It's like having a helper while building our website.

**Magic link - verification**

A magic link is a secure and user-friendly authentication method used to verify a user's identity. Instead of requiring a traditional password, a magic link is sent to the user's registered email address. When the user clicks on the link, it grants them access to a specific resource or action, such as confirming an order. This method enhances security and it provides a convenient way for users to confirm their identity while maintaining a high level of protection against unauthorized access.

<strong>Keywords: </strong> "essential oils, aromatherapy, natural wellness, relaxation, stress healing, wellness products, self-care, wellness rituals, diffuser oils, oils, aromatherapy benefits, natural oils, organic essential oils, therapeutic grade oils, natural solutions, alternative medicine oils, alternative therapy, high-quality essential oils"
